# Predicting rainfall with lots of data

We will implement and deploy a machine learning model using Flask to predict rainfall levels over New South Wales, Australia, using historical data.
The challenge of this project is that the dataset is large so the model cannot be run on our local laptops. We don't yet know how to do this yet, this repo is where it will all come together.
