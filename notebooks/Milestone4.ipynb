Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

    "    \n",
    "    2.2 Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/worker.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",

You have installed it in your TLJH using [Installing pip packages](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#installing-pip-packages). if you want to make it available to users outside of jupyterHub (which you want to in this case as we are logging into EC2 instance as user ```ubuntu``` by giving ```ssh -i privatekey ubuntu@<host_name>```) you can follow these [instructions](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/env/user-environment.html#accessing-user-environment-outside-jupyterhub).\n",

    "9. There are several options we could use to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and which won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try accessing your service again with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "> Before this course, most of our group had never used AWS cloud services, spun an EC2 instance or used feather file formats. Therefore, most of us would have attempted to use brute force to load the rainfall data, wrangle it, and perform machine learning. We obviously would have become frustrated very quickly and some of our computers would have crashed, which was the case in Milestone 1! However, several milestones later we can now spin EC2 instances, create EMR clusters and make use of S3 storage buckets to perform a machine learning pipeline from start to finish. While the journey was a bit confusing and tedious at times, we now have the basic understanding of the tools available to us. It's a fast-paced world that seems to be evolving as the course was being taught. We are confident that with we can turn back to these experiences and the material that's been given to us, to create eligant data pipelines that can be used by ourselves and many others. "
